## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis
### Project Overview
Working as a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. I was tasked with analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

## Dataset Description 
The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including: 
- Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings 
- Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content 
- Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values 
- Total Records: 1,465 | TotalFields: 16 columns

## Analysis Task
Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <$200, $200–$500, >$500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
